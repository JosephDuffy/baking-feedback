# bakingfeedback.com

[bakingfeedback.com](https://bakingfeedback.com) is the web frontend for api.bakingfeedback.com. The website can be used to load and complete surveys about food I bake.

## Why?

I'm trying to learn React (especially animations), Redux, and TypeScript better, especially with the complexities that API calls bring when it comes to response UI and state management. It's also a very simple concept so I get to ðŸ’ª my (weak) design muscle a little without fear of designing it too horribly ðŸ™ˆ

Once the roadmap is complete (possibly minus tests ðŸ¤«) this project is likely to go unmaintained.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Provide results of surveys
- [ ] Provide a page of previous surveys
- [ ] ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- [ ] Add a way to require a password to submit answers to and/or view a survey
- [ ] [Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
